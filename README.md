accessibility
=============

This is an example project to show how easy it is to implement Bold Text, 
Reduced Transparency, Darker Colors and Reduced Motion in iOS. This is a one screen
app that is very simple for demonstration purposes only. To see motion and transparency 
tap on the profile image when the app is running. The image, when tapped will grow and
have a dimmed (transparent) background.

Branches:
master    			- app fully implemented with accessibility featueres

darkerColors		- app implemented with Darker Colors only
