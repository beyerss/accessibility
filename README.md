accessibility
=============

This is an example project to show how easy it is to implement Bold Text, 
Reduced Transparency, Darker Colors and Reduced Motion in iOS. This is a one screen
app that is very simple for demonstration purposes only. To see motion and transparency 
tap on the profile image when the app is running. The image, when tapped will grow and
have a dimmed (transparent) background.

Branches:
master    			- app fully implemented with accessibility featueres
basic     			- app implemented with no accessibility features
boldText 			- app implemented with Bold Text only
reducedTransparency - app implemented with Reduced Transparency only
darkerColors		- app implemented with Darker Colors only
reducedMotion	    - app implemented with Reduced Motion only

voiceOver is a new branch that has the Voice Over feature implemented. It also has a few more UI elements and a second screen that contains a UITableView to help demonstrate the power of Voice Over in different situations.
